## Bus Ticket Booking Application:
It was built using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB Compass typically involves multiple components and modules. You can organize your project into separate modules to keep your codebase maintainable and scalable. Here's a high-level overview of how you can structure your project:

## 1. Frontend Module (React):

   This module focuses on the user interface and user experience of your bus seat booking application. You can structure it into components, containers, and pages.

   - **Components**: Reusable UI components like buttons, forms, and seat selection components.
   - **Containers**: Components that connect to your FastAPI backend, manage state, and pass data to presentational components.
   - **Pages**: Top-level components representing different pages of your application (e.g., home page, booking page, confirmation page).
   - **Routing**: Implement client-side routing using libraries like React Router.

## 2. **Backend Module (FastAPI)**:

   The backend module handles the application's business logic, including handling seat reservations, user authentication, and communication with the database.

   - **Routes**: Organize API routes into separate Python files (e.g., `routes/booking.py`, `routes/user.py`).
   - **Models**: Define Pydantic models for request and response validation.
   - **Database Integration**: Connect to your MongoDB database using an ODM (Object Document Mapper) like PyMongo or use FastAPI's asynchronous support with databases like Motor.
   - **Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization.
   - **Controllers**: Business logic for handling seat bookings, user registration, and other core operations.

## 3. **Database Module (MongoDB with MongoDB Compass)**:

   This module involves managing your database and structuring your data.

   - **Database Schema**: Define the structure of your MongoDB collections (e.g., a "Bookings" collection, a "Users" collection).
   - **Data Access Layer**: Create functions or classes for interacting with the database, such as inserting, updating, and querying data.

## 4. **Authentication and Authorization Module**:

   If your application requires user authentication, this module handles user management, login, and access control.

   - **User Registration**: User registration and account creation.
   - **User Authentication**: Handling user login and token-based authentication.
   - **Authorization Middleware**: Middleware for verifying user access to specific routes.

   Generate API documentation using FastAPI's built-in features, such as auto-generated OpenAPI documentation.

By organizing your project into these modules. You can maintain a clean and structured codebase, making it easier to develop, test, and scale your bus seat booking application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB Compass.
