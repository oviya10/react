    <h2>What is DOM in JS?</h2>
    <h3>DOM:</h3>
    <p1>DOM stands for Document Object Model, and it is a programming interface for web documents. In the context of JavaScript, the DOM is a representation of the structure and content of a web page. It provides a way for scripts to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a document.
       <br>
        <b>Note:</b>
        <br>
        <b>Hierarchical Structure:</b> The DOM represents an HTML or XML document as a tree structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the document is a node in this tree.
        <br>
        <b>JavaScript Interaction:</b> JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically modify the content and structure of a web page. This includes adding or removing elements, changing text, modifying styles, and more.
        <br>
       <b> Platform-Neutral Interface:</b> The DOM provides a platform-neutral programming interface that allows scripts to work consistently across different browsers. This helps ensure that web applications behave consistently regardless of the user's browser.
        <br>
       <b>Document Object:</b> The top-level object in the DOM hierarchy is the document object, which represents the entire HTML document. From this object, you can access and manipulate other elements in the document.</p1>

       <h2>What is the use of DOM manipulation ?</h2>
    <h3>DOM Manipulation:</h3>
    <p1>DOM manipulation is a crucial aspect of web development as it allows developers to dynamically update and modify the content, structure, and style of a web page. 
       <br>
       <b>Updating Content::</b> JavaScript can be used to update the text, attributes, or HTML content of elements on a webpage. This is useful for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
       <br>
       <b>Adding and Removing Elements:</b> Dynamic content can be added or removed from the DOM based on user actions or other events. This is often used in response to user interactions or as part of a dynamic application.
       <br>
      <b>Handling User Input:</b> DOM manipulation is essential for handling user input, such as form submissions, button clicks, and keyboard events. It allows developers to respond to user actions and update the interface accordingly.
       <br>
      <b>Dynamic Styling: </b>  Styles of elements can be dynamically modified to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces. This includes changing CSS classes, styles, and other properties.</p1>
